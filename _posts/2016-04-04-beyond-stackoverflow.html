<p>Most researchers I know in <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/">my department</a> make regular use of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tour">Stack Overflow</a>, the question and answer site for programmers.  While it is the oldest and most popular, there are <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">a family of Q&amp;A sites</a> that closely follow the look and feel of Stack Overflow.  More than a dozen of these target <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#science-name">scientific and mathematical topics</a>, and some are particularly relevant to those of us working in meteorology:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/"><img class="se-logo" src="/images/math-se.png"/>Mathematics</a></dt><dd>Discussions are more rigorous than the mathematics I use in my own work, but this site has helped me with PDEs and calculus, geometric problems, and numerical analyses</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/"><img class="se-logo" src="/images/physics-se.png"/>Physics</a></dt><dd>Perhaps the best place to learn about fluid dynamics, although I haven't used the site very much myself</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://stats.stachexchange.com/"><img class="se-logo" src="/images/crossvalidated-se.png"/>Cross Validated</a></dt><dd>I have yet to use this site, but it's the place for questions about statistics</dd>
  <dt><a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/"><img class="se-logo" src="/images/gis-se.png"/>Geographic Information Systems</a></dt><dd>Again, I've not used this site except <a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/a/109969/68184">to get inspiration for shading relief maps</a> and discuss the <a href="http://twitter.com/search?q=%23endrainbow">merits of rainbow colour scales</a></dd>
</dl>

<p>These sites are already well-established, and new questions are often answered within minutes.  But there are some other sites that are still in beta, with <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/">Earth Science</a> and <a href="http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/">Computational Science</a> being the most relevant to meteorologists.  These sites have smaller communities and new questions can <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers">go unanswered for days or longer</a>.
Answering a question on Stack Overflow often feels like trying to snipe on an eBay auction, but there is rarely such a race for upvotes on smaller sites.
</p>

<p>Compared to Stack Overflow, I've found it easier to participate in the Earth Science community.  As well as answering questions at a more leisurely pace, there are more opportunities to post new questions, too.  And I think that my questions and answers tend to gain more attention at Earth Science than those on Stack Overflow.</p>

<p>The Earth Science site is still maturing and needs to attract more scientists to make it credible.  At present there are, in my opinion, a disproportionate number of <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hypothetical">hypothetical questions</a> and questions that are <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/6847/why-havent-weeds-overtaken-the-entire-planet">mostly</a> for <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/245/is-it-true-that-a-butterfly-flapping-its-wings-can-result-in-a-tornado-in-a-distant-location">fun</a>.
There has been <a href="http://meta.earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/34/level-of-the-questions-so-far">debate</a> amongst the community about <a href="http://meta.earthscience.stackexchange.com/questions/114/are-we-aiming-to-be-an-expert-site">what types of questions are desirable</a> on the site.</p>

<p>There are many other Stack Exchange sites that are not yet at the public beta stage.  These are hosted in &lsquo;<a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/">Area 51</a>&rsquo; and include <a href="http://area51.stackexchange.com/categories/7/science">several with topics relating to sciences, mathematics and teaching</a>.  Finally, the Academia Stack Exchange will explain how <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/3545/what-do-co-supervisors-get-out-of-a-phd">academics</a>, <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/12342/self-plagiarism-in-phd-thesis">students</a>, and <a href="http://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/55665/what-does-the-typical-workflow-of-a-journal-look-like">journals</a> operate.
