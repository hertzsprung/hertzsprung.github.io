<p>This is a revival of the blog previously hosted with Google Blogger.  Inspired by <a href="http://www.carlboettiger.info/lab-notebook.html">Carl Boettiger&rsquo;s open lab notebook</a>, and talks from <a href="http://www.climate-lab-book.ac.uk/author/ed/">Ed Hawkins</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/tomsizmur/home">Tom Sizmur</a> about academics engaging with online communities, I have updated this website to include more information about me, documents and software that I've written, and links to my online presence elsewhere.</p>

<p>I hope to start sharing notes on my research as a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/">Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading</a>, where I am developing numerical methods for atmospheric flows on arbitrary meshes using the <a href="http://www.openfoam.com/">OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library</a>, supervised by <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws02hs/">Hilary Weller</a> and <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~swrmethn/">John Methven</a> at the University of Reading, and <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/our-scientists/dynamics/terry-davies">Terry Davies</a> at the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">UK Met Office</a>.</p>

<p>This site was created using the superb <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> website and blog generator, hosted with <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a>.  The website source is available on <a href="https://github.com/hertzsprung/hertzsprung.github.io">GitHub</a>, should anyone want to reuse or modifying the site's layout and styling.</p>
