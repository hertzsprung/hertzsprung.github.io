title:  "Beyond Stack Overflow"
---
Most researchers I know in <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/">my department</a> make regular use of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tour">Stack Overflow</a>, the question and answer site for programmers.  While it is the oldest and most popular, there are <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">a family of Q&amp;A sites</a> that closely follow the look and feel of Stack Overflow.  More than a dozen of these target <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#science-name">scientific and mathematical topics</a>, and some are particularly relevant to those of us working in meteorology:

<dl>
  <dt>Mathematics</dt><dd></dd>
  <dt>Physics</dt><dd></dd>
  <dt>Cross Validated</dt><dd></dt>
  <dt>Geographic Information Systems</dt><dd></dd>
</dl>

These sites are already well-established, and new questions are often answered within minutes.  But there are some other sites that are still in beta, with <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/">Earth Science</a> and <a href="http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/">Computational Science</a> being the most relevant to meteorologists.  These sites have smaller communities and new questions can <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers">go unanswered for days or longer</a>.  Answering a question on Stack Overflow often feels like trying to snipe on an eBay auction, but there is rarely such a race for upvotes on smaller sites.  Compared to Stack Overflow, I've found it much easier to participate in the Earth Science community.



<todo>then talk about those that are in beta: earthsci and scicomp, and mention area51, give example of opensci</todo>
<todo>do I want to talk about the lack of experts and hypothetical questions</todo>
<todo>finally, mention academia</todo>
