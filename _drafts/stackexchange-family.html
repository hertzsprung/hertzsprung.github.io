title:  "Beyond Stack Overflow"
---
<p>Most researchers I know in <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/">my department</a> make regular use of <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/tour">Stack Overflow</a>, the question and answer site for programmers.  While it is the oldest and most popular, there are <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites">a family of Q&amp;A sites</a> that closely follow the look and feel of Stack Overflow.  More than a dozen of these target <a href="http://stackexchange.com/sites#science-name">scientific and mathematical topics</a>, and some are particularly relevant to those of us working in meteorology:</p>

<todo>describe briefly and give examples of questions relevant to meteorology
<dl>
  <dt><a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/">Mathematics</a></dt><dd></dd>
  <dt><a href="http://physics.stackexchange.com/">Physics</a></dt><dd></dd>
  <dt><a href="http://stats.stachexchange.com/">Cross Validated</a></dt><dd><todo>statistics, haven't used this myself</todo></dd>
  <dt><a href="http://gis.stackexchange.com/">Geographic Information Systems</a></dt><dd></dd>
</dl>

<p>These sites are already well-established, and new questions are often answered within minutes.  But there are some other sites that are still in beta, with <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/">Earth Science</a> and <a href="http://scicomp.stackexchange.com/">Computational Science</a> being the most relevant to meteorologists.  These sites have smaller communities and new questions can <a href="http://earthscience.stackexchange.com/unanswered/tagged/?tab=noanswers">go unanswered for days or longer</a>.
Answering a question on Stack Overflow often feels like trying to snipe on an eBay auction, but there is rarely such a race for upvotes on smaller sites.
</p>

<p>Compared to Stack Overflow, I've found it easier to participate in the Earth Science community.  As well as answering questions at a more leisurely pace, there are more opportunities to post new questions, too.  I've found that my questions and answers tend to gain more attention at Earth Science than those on Stack Overflow.</p>


<todo>then talk about those that are in beta: earthsci and scicomp, and mention area51, give example of opensci</todo>
<todo>do I want to talk about the lack of experts and hypothetical questions</todo>
<todo>finally, mention academia</todo>
