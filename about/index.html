<p>I am James Shaw, a PhD student in the <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/">Department of Meteorology</a> at the <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/">University of Reading</a>.  I am developing numerical methods for atmospheric flows on arbitrary meshes using the <a href="http://www.openfoam.com/">OpenFOAM computational fluid dynamics library</a>, supervised by <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~sws02hs/">Hilary Weller</a> and <a href="http://www.met.reading.ac.uk/~swrmethn/">John Methven</a> at the University of Reading, and <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/our-scientists/dynamics/terry-davies">Terry Davies</a> at the <a href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/">UK Met Office</a>.</p>

<p>Prior to this, I attained a <a href="http://www.reading.ac.uk/ready-to-study/study/subject-area/meteorology-and-climate-pg/mscpg-diploma-in-atmosphere-ocean-and-climate.aspx">Masters degree in Atmosphere, Ocean and Climate</a>.  My dissertation, also supervised by Hilary Weller, compared <a href="/publications/msc-dissertation.pdf">alternative representations of mountains in idealised atmospheric simulations</a>.  I continued this research in my PhD and have had an <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/MWR-D-15-0226.1">article accepted for publication in Monthly Weather Review</a>, coauthored by Hilary Weller.</p>

<p>Before returning to academia, I was a software developer, working with the server engineering team headed by the <a href="https://jaxenter.com/tests-need-love-113991.html">TDD guru</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tddmonkey">Colin Vipurs</a>.  In particular, I helped to develop <a href="https://jersey.java.net/">REST</a>, <a href="http://redis.io/">redis</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> infrastructure in Java.</p>
