<p>I&rsquo;m James Shaw, a software engineer at <a href="https://www.thefloow.com">The Floow</a>, where I write code to promote safer driving.

<p>
Prior to this, I worked in academia developing <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/geography/research/hydrology/models/lisflood/">LISFLOOD-FP</a> finite element solvers for flood forecasting at <a href="https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/civil">The University of Sheffield</a>, and <a href="https://www.openfoam.org">OpenFOAM</a> finite volume solvers for weather forecasting at the <a href="https://www.reading.ac.uk/met/">University of Reading</a>.

<p>Before returning to academia, I worked in the server engineering team at <a href="https://www.shazam.com">Shazam</a>,  headed by the <a href="https://jaxenter.com/tests-need-love-113991.html">test-driven development guru</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tddmonkey">Colin Vipurs</a>.</p>
